### Recent Work

My most recent work as a Freelance videography & editor has been for the ROBLOX Deepwoken Content Creator [Agamatsu.](https://www.youtube.com/c/agamatsu)

Creating a Raid Shadow Legends Sponsorship section, while this video is still yet to come out I've been allowed to post the Sponsorship section as an unlisted video for you to look through & critique.
